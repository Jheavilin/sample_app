# **************************************************
# 
#   Thank you for installing rspec-rails-2.0.1!
# 
#   This version of rspec-rails only works with versions of rails >= 3.0.0
# 
#   To configure your app to use rspec-rails, add a declaration to your Gemfile.
#   If you are using Bundler's grouping feature in your Gemfile, be sure to include
#   rspec-rails in the :development group as well as the :test group so that you
#   can access its generators and rake tasks.
# 
#     group :development, :test do
#       gem "rspec-rails", ">= 2.0.1"
#     end
# 
#   Be sure to run the following command in each of your Rails apps if you're
#   upgrading:
# 
#     script/rails generate rspec:install
# 
#   Even if you've run it before, this ensures that you have the latest updates
#   to spec/spec_helper.rb and any other support files.
# 
#   Beta versions of rspec-rails-2 installed files that are no longer being used,
#   so please remove these files if you have them:
